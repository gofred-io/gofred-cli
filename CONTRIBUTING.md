## Code of Conduct

This project adheres to a code of conduct. By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please report unacceptable behavior to the maintainers.

## Getting Started

1. Fork the repository on GitHub
2. Clone your fork locally
3. Create a new branch for your feature or bugfix
4. Make your changes
5. Test your changes thoroughly
6. Submit a pull request

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Go 1.25.1 or later
- Git
- Make (optional, for using the Makefile)

### Building from Source

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/gofred-io/gofred-cli.git
   cd gofred-cli
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   go mod download
   ```

3. Build the project:
   ```bash
   go build -o gofred .
   ```

   Or use the Makefile:
   ```bash
   make build
   ```

### Running Tests

```bash
go test ./...
```

### Running the CLI

After building, you can run the CLI:
```bash
./gofred --help
```

## Making Changes

### Code Style

- Follow Go conventions and best practices
- Use `gofmt` to format your code
- Use `golint` or `golangci-lint` to check for issues
- Write clear, self-documenting code
- Add comments for public functions and complex logic

### Commit Messages

Use clear, descriptive commit messages:

- Use the imperative mood ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Keep the first line under 50 characters
- Add a blank line between the subject and body
- Use the body to explain what and why, not how

Example:
```
Add support for custom package names

The create command now accepts a --package flag to specify
a custom package name for the generated application.
This allows users to create apps with meaningful names
instead of the default "gofred-app".
```

### Testing

- Write tests for new functionality
- Ensure all existing tests pass
- Test on multiple platforms if possible
- Test edge cases and error conditions

## Submitting Changes

### Pull Request Process

1. **Create a feature branch** from `main`:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Make your changes** following the guidelines above

3. **Test your changes** thoroughly

4. **Commit your changes** with clear commit messages

5. **Push to your fork**:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

6. **Create a Pull Request** on GitHub

### Pull Request Guidelines

- Provide a clear description of what the PR does
- Reference any related issues
- Include screenshots or examples if applicable
- Ensure all CI checks pass
- Keep PRs focused and reasonably sized
- Respond to feedback promptly

### Review Process

- All PRs require review from maintainers
- Address feedback promptly
- Be open to suggestions and improvements
- Maintain a positive, collaborative attitude

## Issue Guidelines
