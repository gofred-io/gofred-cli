## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security vulnerabilities seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow these steps:

### 1. Do NOT create a public GitHub issue

Security vulnerabilities should be reported privately to avoid potential harm to users.

### 2. Report via email

Please send an email to [security@gofred.io](mailto:security@gofred.io) with the following information:

- **Subject**: Security Vulnerability Report - [Brief Description]
- **Description**: Detailed description of the vulnerability
- **Steps to reproduce**: Clear steps to reproduce the issue
- **Impact**: Potential impact of the vulnerability
- **Affected versions**: Which versions are affected
- **Suggested fix**: If you have suggestions for fixing the issue

### 3. What to expect

- **Acknowledgment**: You will receive an acknowledgment within 48 hours
- **Initial assessment**: We will provide an initial assessment within 5 business days
- **Regular updates**: We will keep you informed of our progress
- **Resolution**: We will work with you to resolve the issue

### 4. Responsible disclosure

We follow responsible disclosure practices:

- We will not publicly disclose the vulnerability until it has been fixed
- We will credit you in our security advisories (unless you prefer to remain anonymous)
- We will work with you to coordinate the disclosure timeline

## Security Best Practices

### For Users

- Always use the latest version of Gofred CLI
- Keep your Go installation up to date
- Be cautious when downloading and running binaries
- Verify checksums when available
- Report suspicious behavior immediately

### For Developers

- Follow secure coding practices
- Keep dependencies up to date
- Use security scanning tools
- Implement proper input validation
- Follow the principle of least privilege

## Security Features

Gofred CLI implements several security features:

- **Checksum verification**: Downloaded binaries are verified against checksums
- **Secure defaults**: Sensible security defaults out of the box
- **Minimal permissions**: Only requests necessary permissions
- **Sandboxed execution**: WebAssembly provides additional isolation

## Known Security Considerations

### WebAssembly Security

- WebAssembly runs in a sandboxed environment
- Limited access to system resources
- No direct file system access (except through provided APIs)

### Network Security

- All network requests use HTTPS when possible
- CDN downloads are verified against checksums
- No sensitive data is transmitted in plain text

### File System Security

- Applications are created in user-specified directories
- No automatic execution of downloaded code
- User has full control over file permissions

## Security Updates

Security updates are released as soon as possible after a vulnerability is discovered and fixed. Updates are announced through:

- GitHub releases
- Security advisories
- Email notifications (for critical vulnerabilities)

## Contact

For security-related questions or concerns, please contact:

- **Email**: [security@gofred.io](mailto:security@gofred.io)
- **GitHub**: Create a private security advisory

## Acknowledgments

We thank the security researchers and community members who help keep Gofred CLI secure by reporting vulnerabilities and suggesting improvements.
